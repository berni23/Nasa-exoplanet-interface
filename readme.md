<h4>Exoplanet Archive</h4>



The Exoplanet Archive API allows programatic access to [NASA's Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) database. This API contains a ton of options so to get started please visit [this page](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interfaces.html) for introductory materials. To see [what data](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html) is available in this API [visit here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interfaces.html#data) and also be sure to check out [best-practices and troubleshooting](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interfaces.html#troubleshoot) in case you get stuck.



<h5>Example queries</h5>



* confirmed planets that transit their host stars :
